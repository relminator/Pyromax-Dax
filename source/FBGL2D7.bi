''    Version 0.7.5
''    Easy GL2D (FB.IMAGE compatible version)
''    By Relminator (Richard Eric M. Lope)
''    http://rel.phatcode.net
''    
''    An easy to use OpenGL 2d lib
''    As easy as fbgfx (easier IMHO if you use my Texture packer)
''    
''    Can automatically load BMP's supported by BLOAD
''    Adds alpha transparency if you want
''    No external dependencies (only uses OpenGL/GLU and FBGFX)
''    Source license is "use or abuse"
